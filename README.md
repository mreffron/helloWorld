My ideas and projects

Hello I am a science teacher digging into the world of computer science and engineering.  I teach inner city middle grade students (10-14yrs) in a computer lab and want to engage them into the HelloWorld. They have limited exposer to computers and electronics but many enjoy playing/consuming video games and videos.  I want them to create!

Wish me luck-
